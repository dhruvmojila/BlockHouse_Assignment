### Libraries and Tools Used

#### Frontend (Next.js):
- **ApexCharts**: For data visualization and charts.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the UI.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to the backend.

#### Backend (Django REST API):

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: For building RESTful APIs.
- **Django CORS Headers**: To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests from the frontend.

## Thought Process and Approach

As a React, React Native, and Node.js developer, I initially faced some uncertainty since Django and Next.js were new to me. However, I quickly adapted by reading documentation, learning the necessary tools, and implementing the project. This assignment showcases my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new frameworks and languages as needed.

It took me approximately 24 hours to complete this task, and I'm satisfied with the outcome, as I not only accomplished the assignment but also gained valuable knowledge along the way.
